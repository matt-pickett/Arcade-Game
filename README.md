If the player eats the larger circles, the ghosts will turn blue for a short time and Pacman will be able to eat them just like fruit to gain points.

After a certain amount of fruit has been eaten, a large red 'cherry' fruit will spawn. This fruit is worth more points than any other fruit, and will net a lot of points if eaten!
